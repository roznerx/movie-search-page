# Create a page that allows users to search for movies

> This repository is the companion to the [reactpractice.dev exercise to create a movie search page](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/create-a-movie-search-page/). Check out the blog post for more details.

Create a page that allows users to search for movies.
It should consist of a search input box and a search button.
When the user clicks “Search”, the page should show the search results.

You can use the free public “The Movie Database” API to search for the movie details.

Implementation notes:

- Use a custom hook to encapsulate the data fetching logic
- Make sure the page fails gracefully if the API returns an error
- Use axios for the data fetching

What you will practice:

- Working with API keys for connecting to an API
- Data fetching and error handling
- Structuring your app component tree
- Working with custom hooks
